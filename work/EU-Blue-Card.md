The EU Blue Card for Germany is a work and residence permit, issued to highly skilled individuals, allowing them to work in professions where there is a shortage or which have future prospects. It allows the holder to live and work in Germany for up to four years at first and extend the stay if they still meet the requirements. 

From my personal experience, I can confirm that getting it is not such an unaffordable task. 

No proof of German language skills needs to be provided in order to issue an EU Blue Card.

🔸 You have a minimum annual gross salary of 56,800 Euros. (!! As of 2021 – the salary thresholds are readjusted for each calendar year !!)

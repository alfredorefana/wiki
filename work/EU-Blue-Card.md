# EU Blue Card
The EU Blue Card for Germany is a work and residence permit, issued to highly skilled individuals, allowing them to work in professions where there is a shortage or which have future prospects. It allows the holder to live and work in Germany for up to four years at first and extend the stay if they still meet the requirements. 

From my personal experience, I can confirm that getting it is not such an unaffordable task. 

**No proof of German language skills needs to be provided in order to issue an EU Blue Card.**


## Requirements

For Germany, you must meet the following pre-conditions in order to be qualified for the EU Blue Card:

- You have a specific university degree: 
    - From a German university or
    - If you did not acquire your degree in Germany, it must either be recognized or comparable to a German degree.  You can check the “anabin” database to see whether your foreign degree is recognized. Link below.

- You have an employment contract or a binding job offer.

- The employment must match the qualification.

- You have a minimum annual gross salary of **56,800 Euros**. _(!! As of 2021 – the salary thresholds are readjusted for each calendar year !!)_

    - A reduced minimum annual gross salary of 44,304 Euros applies to employment in the occupational fields of mathematics, IT, computer science, the natural sciences, engineering and human medicine (not including dentistry).
    
    - In above cases, the German Federal Employment Agency must approve your request for employment.

 

## Application process

The following documents are required if you’re applying for EU Blue Card in Munich. I highly recommend to contact the local authorities if you are currently in Germany or consult their official website. Do not blindly rely on all of written in here as the application process changes very fast lately

## For those who are living outside of Germany

If living outside of Germany, you will generally require an entry visa for the purpose of gainful employment which will be issued by the nearest German Embassy or Consulate in your country of residence. Prior to expiry of the visa, you must subsequently apply to the local immigration authority for the EU Blue Card.


## Validity of the EU Blue Card

- The EU Blue Card is a temporary residence permit that is issued for a period of four years. 
- It can be extended if certain requirements are fulfilled.
- If the duration of the employment contract is shorter than four years, the EU Blue Card is issued for the duration of the employment contract, plus three (03) months. 
- For any change of job within the first two years of employment, a permit from the competent immigration authority is required. The conditions for granting the Blue Card will then be re-examined.


## Benefits of the EU Blue Card

- Faster acquisition of a settlement permit: 
    - Holders of an EU Blue Card will receive a settlement permit after 33 months in Germany if they have been in highly-qualified employment and paid contributions into a pension fund during this period, and possess a basic command of the German language (A1 level in accordance with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)). 
    
    - The qualification period is shortened to 21 months for persons with an adequate knowledge of German (level B1).
    
    - You have basic knowledge of the legal and social order in Germany.

- Relaxation of the conditions for family reunification:
    - Family members of a Blue Card holder are allowed an unrestricted right to work in Germany. 
    - Spouses do not have to speak German to join the Blue Card holder in the country.

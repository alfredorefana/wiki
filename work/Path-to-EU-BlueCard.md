# My path to EU BlueCard  

Today, in this post I will share with you my path to get where I am now: a ‚ÄúLevel 1 IT-Engineer‚Äù.
As always, I take record of everything when I started the job hunting as described in here.
I applied for this position on January 27th, 2021 via LinkedIn. And I received an invitation Email from the company on February 8th, 2021. 

So here it goes ‚Ä¶

The followings are the interview steps I had in order fully land the job.

## Background check

Once the both sides are happy and liked each other, now it time for the background check. For the background check, there was a form I needed to fill in and sent to them with the following documents:

- Employee Screening Questionnaire
- Photo ID (passport, driver‚Äôs license)
- One utility bill for each address over the past 5 years.
- One bank statement at current address
- A copy of academic transcripts or degree certificates for each relevant qualification

End of march, we waved the agreement and signed the employment contract, and on the same day I visited the migration office and applied for EU BlueCard.

I do hope that my path described above would give you some overviews of what is waiting for you if you‚Äôre planning to relocate and work in Germany as an Engineer. 

Nothing is easy in this life. You need perseverance and to be focused on achieving your goals.

Peace!

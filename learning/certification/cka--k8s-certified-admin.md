# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

In this page, I'll try to give answers to question "How to nail the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam on the first attempt?" by sharing some experiences from my own CKA journey, and if you’re targeting the same destination, hopefully, it can add some help!

## Why CKA?

The purpose of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program is to provide assurance that CKAs have the skills, knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes administrators. 
So this certificate demonstrates your competency, establishes your credibility and value in the job market, and hopefully makes you stand out in front of employer.  

Details on the exam you can read [here from CNF](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) and [here from Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/).

The CKA is hard but a rewarding certification. The amazing thing about it is that it's hands-on and practical, which means no memorization or multiple-choice questions.
Always hatted questions and too many words stuff. 


## Highlights about this exam in case you don’t know it yet

- Online-proctored exam, performance-based (NOT multi-choice-question), you need to solve 17-20 challenges on an RDP environment (via PSI secure browser) by Kubernetes commands.

- Duration of Exam 2 hours

- Certification Valid for 3 Years

- Passing score: 66/100.

- Exam fee: 395$ (as of Jan.2023). Discount coupons are available sometimes, on Black Friday or Cyber Monday for example)


## My Comprehensive List of Study Resources

### Prerequisites 

There is no prior knowledge required, but if you’re good at Docker and Linux, it would help a lot.

### How to study?

I used the following materials and platforms to prepare for the CKA exam:

- [Introduction to Containers and Docker](https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-containers-and-docker)
- [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-kubernetes)

    - Good course
    - Well organized in term of presentation and explanation
    - they offer playground, and you don't need to think of how to create your cluster for each lab
    - Free cluster for labs
    - Unfortunately, the course's contents are not up-to-date to the CKA curricilum 
    - labs are poor and too easy, so don't rely on them for clearing the exam

- [Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258) from Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/)

    - Very Up-to-date with the [CKA cirrucilum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum)
    - theory well explained and structured
    - practice exercises and labs are very well prepared and explained in detail for your understading
    - You can purchase this course in bundle with the exam


- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator labs](https://kodekloud.com/courses/labs-certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/)

    - very good lab/test cases
    - They have some lightning exams and mock exams, you should repeat them a few times to get familiar with K8S stuff and improve the speed.
    - lab’s difficulty level is close to the real exam


- [CKS/CKA/CKAD Simulator -- killer.sh](https://killer.sh/cka)

    - 2 free runs with exam purchase
    - do at least ONCE (timed) then REVIEW
    - the explanations are very well done, read them all
    - questions and scenarios are harder than real exam
    - Your environment is open for the following 36hrs after activation, so you can go back and reflect/check etc

# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

In this page, I share how I prepared to pass the CKA exam.


## My Comprehensive List of Study Resources

- [Introduction to Containers and Docker](https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-containers-and-docker)

- [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://acloudguru.com/course/introduction-to-kubernetes)

- [Introduction to OpenShift](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/introduction-to-openshift/overview)

- [Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners - Hands-on](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-kubernetes/)

- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), ACloudGuru course](https://acloudguru.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka)

    - Very good course
    - Well organized in term of presentation and explanation
    - they offer playground, and you don't need to think of how to create your cluster for each lab
    - Lab
    - Unfortunately, the course's contents are not up-to-date to the CKA curricilum 
    - a bit poor in term exam prep labs

- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/)

    - More-or-less Up-to-date with the CKA cirrucilum

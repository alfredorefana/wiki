# Moving WhatsApp to a new phone: Transferring backups & restoring

## The easiest way to do this is: Google Drive backup and restore

**Note:**

1. use same Google Account on both phones,
2. Backup and restore your Whatsapp data to/from online backup. 


I do not really like sending my data online, so I prefer to do an offline transfer. I know, kinda "Old-School", but yeah, it's a better way to avoid data loss and breach. And in addition, I use different Google account on both phones. 


## Few steps to follow doing the offline transfer 

1. On the old phone:
    - Make a backup of of your Whatsapp data
    - Connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB cable.
    - Copy somewhere the Whatsapp files from: >> Internal storage >> Android >> media >> com.whatsapp >> 

2. On the new phone:
  - connect it to the PC via an usb cable
  - copy over the above files to the same directory on the new phone
  - Open Whatsapp application
  - register using the same number from the old phone. You might need to verify via sms token code or a call
  - make sure to use the "restore from backup" option as this will show only once.

Enjoy your chat on your new phone :)

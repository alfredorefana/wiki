Moving WhatsApp to a new phone: Transferring backups & restoring


The easiest way to do this is: Google Drive backup and restore
Note:
1. use same Google Account on both phones,
2. Backup and restore your Whatsapp data to/from online backup. 


I do not really like sending my data online, so I prefer to do an offline transfer. I know, kinda Old-School, but yeah, it's a better way to avoid data loss. And in addition, I use different Google account on both phones. 

Few steps to follow doing the offline transfer: 
1. On the old phone:
  a) Make a backup of of your Whatsapp data
  b) Connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB cable.
  c) Copy somewhere the Whatsapp files from: >> Internal storage >> Android >> media >> com.whatsapp >> 

2. On the new phone:
  a) connect it to the PC vi usb cable
  b) copy over the above files to the same directory on the new phone
  c) Open Whatsapp application
  d) register using the same number from the old phone. You might need to verify via sms token code or a call
  e) make sure to use the "restore from backup" option as this will show only once.

Enjoy your chat on your new phone
